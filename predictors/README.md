HeteroMap Examples
==================

You can run ```make``` to create executables for each program or use the following commands below

To run decision_tree_model, do:
  ```./decision_tree_model rows multiple_benchmark_input.csv```

rows exhibits how many benchmark-input combinations to predict in the .csv file.

The .csv file contains the benchmark and input model for a particular benchmark-input combination.
You can add a benchmark to multiple_benchmark_input.csv with its input variables to predict the accelerator choices.

One can also use just one benchmark-input combination in file benchmark_input.csv using one row as an argument.

To recreate the predicted inter- and intra-accelerator choices in the paper, just use the variables from 
multiple_benchmark_input.csv to create the required benchmark-input combinations.
